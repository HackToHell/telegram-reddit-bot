A little something I wrote when I found out about Telegram's awesome bot system. Uses `node-telegram-bot` (which is very very new), the wrapper doesn't support custom keyboards and commands. Going to wait for them to add it or better yet send a PR. 

In the store as tg://resolve?domain=Reddit_image_bot / http://telegram.me/Reddit_image_bot.

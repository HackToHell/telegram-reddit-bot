A little something I wrote when I found out about Telegram's awesome bot system. Uses `node-telegram-bot` (which is very very new), the wrapper doesn't support custom keyboards and commands. Going to wait for them to add it or better yet send a PR. Don't have a place to host this at the moment so not going to tell the name of the bot in the telegram store.

imgur-sucker
============

A command line utility for vacuuming a subreddit's images right off of imgur

You can run this command from any location, but know it will create a */sucked/* folder in your current working directory
and will add subdirectories based on the subreddits that you pull. If logging is turned on, it will also create a json file with image vitals.

You will need an Imgur Application Client Id to run this app. To get a client ID: https://api.imgur.com/oauth2/addclient


Usage: imgursucker [options]

  Options:

    -h, --help                             output usage information
    -V, --version                          output the version number
    -c, --client-id <imgur App Client Id>  imgur client id
    -p, --pages <pages>                    number of pages to suck [10]
